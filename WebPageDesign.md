# **How does the _HTML_ and _CSS_ work togather to create a WEB PAGE**?

When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. 
These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. 
An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer
The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. 
A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browse.
