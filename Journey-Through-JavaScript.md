Welcome Back my reader FREINDS, lets start with what I have learnt today which JAVASCRIPT Langauge.

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
This language allow to life to the web so you can see some functionalty on it.

so how does the JS wrote :)
## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT 

there are some data type you should deal with them 
1. NUMBERS Any type of numbers!
2. STRING ANY character on your keyboard!
3. BOOLEANS which is TRUE 1 & FULS 0

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 

* Create a folder to put the example in called cOl, then start
up your favorite code editor, and enter the text to the right. A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a .js file extension, so save this file with the name add-content .js
* Get the CSS and images
 _ for example this is my FIRST JS Code :)_

var flwType=prompt("Which Type Of flowers Do You Preferred? Winter or Summer!"); 
var flType=flwType.toLowerCase();
if (flType=="winter"){
    alert("Welcome to Winter Page!");
    location.replace("https://emanalazzam.github.io/HTMLPag/")} 
else if (flType=="summer"){ alert("Welcome to Summer Page!");
    location.replace("https://halakhamayseh.github.io/HTML_SCC/")} 

When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML script between <> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

* In your code editor, enter the HTML shown on the left. Save this file with the name add-content.html and add this into your html ** <script>src="js/ add-content.js">/ script>**

** and then your code is applied with JS**


### Another Thing which is also new to ME! is OBJECTS& METHODES 

This one line shows how to create a methods and objects in JS
document.write("good afternoon")
document. is objects
write("good afternoon") is methods

## STATEMENTS 
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 
_JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE_
_STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE_
_STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS_
## COMMENTS 
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.
EX on MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS 
/* Th i s script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time. It is an example from JavaScript & jQuer y book */
EX on SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS 
## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 
to declear variables just hit var NAME;
you can assign thim using **=** to any datatype
