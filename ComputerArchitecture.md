# Introducing how computer Work!

what makes a computer computer!
computers are almost every where these days it designed to manipulat information 

these four things are commen to all computers 

* INPUT 
* STORAGE
* PROCESSING
* OUTPUT

and becouse of my backgraound as an Engineer! I'm going to discrib How the LOGIC CIRCUTS process the coming inputs and generate ourput :)

Every input the computer reseve convert it into a type of information which can be represent as on of off electrical signals. 
so to process the information that comes in as input, and to give a refection of it as output a computer needs ti modify and combine the input signals. And to do this computer held a millions of tiny electronic components, which come togather to form circuts.

this simple circut for example flips the input, so if give it  it will give 0, and because the output is not the same as input we call this signal is NOTE!
more complicated circuits can take mulipule signals and combine them and give you a different result 
and also you can put togather multiple circuts side by side with specific connections to resolve a multi task.

back in elder days these circuits were very big as a fridge, a and it would take a munites for them to preform a simple calculations.
tody a computer circuits are microscopic in size and way too fast, and that for a reson for smaller size circuit means smaller way to reach.
