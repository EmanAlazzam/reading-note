# **Git**

Now What is Git?
Git is the most populer vrsion control system in the world, which records the changes made to our code over time in a special database called repository we can look at our repository history and see who has mad the changes, when and why.
withou a VCS we will have constantly store copies of entir projects in various folders this is very slow and unpractical at all especially if a multiple people work on the same project.

so with VCS you can: 
* Trak History 
* Work Togather 

there are two categories:
1. Centralized: all team members connect into a central server the latest version of the code.
3. Distributed: every team member have a version of the project locally on their machine.
