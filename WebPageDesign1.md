## **How Does the HTML and CSS work togather to create a WEB PAGE?

Now It's time to see how to desing the presentation of the web page.
for the same **ctrl+shift+I** it's not only HTML it's also contain a CSS writing, which you can say that it is overlabed whith HTML. 
The CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

**Understanding CSS: Thinking Inside the Box**
## **There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code**.
The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. CSS properties affect how elements are displayed

Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters (also known as escape codes or entity references). For example, to write a left angled bracket, you can use either &lt; or &#60;. For an ampersand, you can use either &amp; or &#38;.
There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright and trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and some punctuation marks. For example, if you want to include a copyright symbol on a web page you can use either &copy; or &#169;.
When using escape characters, it is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. 
This is because some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify a different font for these characters in your CSS code.

THERE ARE A LOT Of commands for CSS and to figure this out you need a long time in order to save some but here some of what I learnt yesterday:
**There are five Types of CSS selector but I only know three for now :)**
1. The CSS element Selector: The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
2. The CSS id Selector: The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
3. The CSS class Selector: The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
## **COLORS**

For Ex: Background Color

background-color command
body {
background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}

You can add the color by: Name *MediumAquaMarine*, Hex Codes *#66cdaa*, RGB Values *rgb(102,205,17)*, which all refer to the same color

Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
