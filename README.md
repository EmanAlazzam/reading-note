Dear Readers 

The Growth Mindset is unbelievable thing it is something like forcing yourself to love learning, keep gaining knowledge, and explor stuff. The more you make effort the more you get improved and make difference in your life.

There is a saying by _Thomas Jefferson_: 
>"**I Find That The Harder I Work, The More Luck I Seem To Have**"

In another words, growth mindset is changing the fixed mind you have to a dynamic mide that have tha ability to develop.

In my story when I graduated I find out that the wrold isn't that easy it is very hard to follow, and the lockdown cames out and everything was depressing so; i started to losing hope in making difference and my life was to pass days without any touchable improvment.
but while searching i find out many usefull web sites that conain many online courses with great topics, so day by day I started to challenging myself to learn at least one new thing.

In the begining with all the difference websites and many topices, I started to lose focus on what is the most usefull things for me i started to search for help and ask people to and learn from other on how and what to search. and so i started to learn Python, MATLAB, Image Processing, Signal Prcessing .. etc

It was very challenging to commit on the courses in order to finishing them, and putting alot of effort, in some days i stayed up all night in order to finish some projects.
and this is the consept of mindset 

First you need to challenge yourself to learn, Then you need to focus and avoid distacting and remamber NO PAIN NO GAIN so; you have to work hard, and it's not bad to learn form your friend, colleague or people and get inspired by them. Finally you will reach the goal successfully.

In the end I want to remind myself and others to:
* Keep the hard working you never know what the future will brings to you  
* Even if you face some problems, I'm telling you that you will find the solutions from the porblem themselfs
* Do not lose hope.
